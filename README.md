# BasicHTML-JS

This site is a simple collection of JavaScript exercises that I have completed.

Each `.js` file will link up to the corresponding individual `.html` pages. I will probably include some basic CSS for the nav-bar & future exercises. The IDE I will be using is Visual Studio Code which you can find [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
